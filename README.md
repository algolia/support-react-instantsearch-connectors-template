## React InstantSearch v7 Connectors (Hooks)

This repository is meant as a starting point for anyone who wants to use React InstantSearch connectors (aka hooks).

Hooks are the headless counterparts of widgets. They return APIs to build the UI as you see fit.

If you feel limited by the provided customization options, you can use Hooks to control the render output. This is useful when using React InstantSearch together with a component library or when rendering to a non-DOM target like React Native.

Hooks can also be helpful if you want to create a custom behavior or a radically different UI based on the APIs of an existing widget. For more on this please see our React InstantSearch Documentation [Customize the complete UI of the widgets](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/widgets/customize-an-existing-widget/react/#customize-the-complete-ui-of-the-widgets)
